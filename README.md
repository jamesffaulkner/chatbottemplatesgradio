# Gradio Templates

## Goals
The purpose of this repository is to share Gradio chatbot templates with others, especially educators, who want to make custom GPTs more accessible to students. Currently, the templates use the OpenAI API to access the ChatGPT model, but other LLMs could be used. To avoid having users subscribe to ChatGPT Plus or sign-up for a third-party app that hosts custom GPTs, you can share your custom GPT over Gradio at just the rate of the API call [fractions of cents per use for ChatGPT](https://openai.com/pricing). Gradio allows you to host your GPT and give users a shareable to it.
